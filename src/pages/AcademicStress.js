            <h2 className="subsectionTitle">Symptoms</h2>
            <p className="infoParagraph">
              Procrastination manifests as delaying tasks despite knowing their
              importance. Students may experience increased anxiety as deadlines
              approach, incomplete assignments, and a persistent feeling of
              guilt or inadequacy.
            </p>

            <h2 className="subsectionTitle">Causes</h2>
            <p className="infoParagraph">
              Procrastination can stem from various factors, such as fear of
              failure, perfectionism, or feeling overwhelmed by the size or
              complexity of a task. Low motivation, distractions (like social
              media), or a lack of clarity about where to start also contribute
              significantly. In some cases, it may be a symptom of deeper
              issues, such as anxiety or poor time management habits.
            </p>

            <h2 className="subsectionTitle">Strategies</h2>
            <p className="infoParagraph">
              Combat procrastination by breaking tasks into smaller, actionable
              steps that feel less intimidating. For example, instead of "write
              the paper," aim for "create an outline" or "write the
              introduction." Build routines and habits around consistent work
              times, and incorporate accountability mechanisms, like study
              groups or productivity partners, to maintain focus. Use
              prioritization techniques, such as the Eisenhower Matrix, to
              determine which tasks are most urgent or important. Lastly,
              address emotional barriers like fear of failure by reminding
              yourself that starting imperfectly is better than not starting at
              all.
            </p>

            <h2 className="subsectionTitle">Actionable Advice</h2>
            <p className="infoParagraph">
              1. Start Small: Begin with a single, manageable action, such as
              setting up your workspace or opening the document you need to work
              on. Momentum often builds after the initial step.
              <br />
              2. Use the Pomodoro Technique: Work in focused intervals, such as
              25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute break. This method can
              reduce feelings of overwhelm and increase productivity over time.
              <br />
              3. Create Accountability: Share your goals with a friend or mentor
              and set regular check-ins to discuss progress. Knowing someone is
              aware of your deadlines can increase motivation.
              <br />
              4. Limit Distractions: Turn off notifications, use
              website-blocking tools, and create a dedicated, clutter-free study
              space to improve focus.
              <br />
              5. Reward Yourself: Set up small rewards for completing
              milestones, such as a short walk, a snack, or a favorite activity,
              to reinforce positive behaviors and keep motivation high.

          <h2 className="subsectionTitle">Symptoms</h2>
          <p className="infoParagraph">
            Poor time management leads to missed deadlines, last-minute work,
            and chronic stress. Students may feel overwhelmed and struggle to
            balance academic, social, and personal responsibilities.
          </p>

          <h2 className="subsectionTitle">Causes</h2>
          <p className="infoParagraph">
            This often arises from overcommitting, failing to prioritize tasks,
            or underestimating the time required for activities. A lack of
            structured routines further compounds the issue.
          </p>

          <h2 className="subsectionTitle">Strategies</h2>
          <p className="infoParagraph">
            Adopt structured planning techniques, such as creating a daily
            schedule or using time-blocking. Prioritize tasks based on urgency
            and importance using methods like the Eisenhower Matrix. Reflect
            weekly on what strategies worked and adjust your plans accordingly.

          <h2 className="subsectionTitle">Actionable Advice</h2>
          <p className="infoParagraph">
            1. Start each day by listing your top three priorities and focus on
            those first.
            <br />
            2. Use a planner or digital app like Google Calendar to allocate
            time effectively.
            <br />
            3. Schedule regular, short breaks to avoid burnout during long study
            sessions.
            <br />
            4. Reflect at the end of the week to identify productivity
            roadblocks and solutions.
            <br />
            5. Delegate or eliminate non-essential commitments to free up time

            <h2 className="subsectionTitle">Symptoms</h2>
            <p className="infoParagraph">
              Perfectionism is characterized by excessive focus on details,
              difficulty finishing tasks due to high standards, and
              dissatisfaction even with quality work. This can lead to stress,
              procrastination, or burnout.
            </p>

            <h2 className="subsectionTitle">Causes</h2>
            <p className="infoParagraph">
              It often stems from the need for external validation, fear of
              criticism, or self-imposed pressure to excel. Unrealistic
              expectations or overvaluing outcomes over effort may also drive
              perfectionism.
            </p>

            <h2 className="subsectionTitle">Strategies</h2>
            <p className="infoParagraph">
              Shift your mindset from “perfect or nothing” to “progress over
              perfection.” Focus on completing tasks efficiently rather than
              flawlessly. Seek feedback early in the process to avoid
              overanalyzing. Normalize the idea that mistakes are part of growth
              and improvement.
            </p>

            <h2 className="subsectionTitle">Actionable Advice</h2>
            <p className="infoParagraph">
              1. Set a time limit for tasks to prevent over-focusing on minor
              details.
              <br />
              2. Use affirmations like “Good enough is enough” to challenge
              perfectionist thinking.
              <br />
              3. Regularly remind yourself of the big picture—perfection in one
              task doesn’t guarantee overall success.
              <br />
              4. Finish tasks at 80% completion for non-critical work to
              practice letting go of perfectionism.
              <br />
              5. Reward yourself for completing tasks on time, even if they’re
              not flawless.

              Disinterest in a subject often results in low motivation,

            <h2 className="subsectionTitle">Causes</h2>
